/*
Package subexp provides extensions to the Go regexp standard library
to make using sub-expressions easier.  Other regular expression
documentation refers to these expressions as "named capture groups",
so some of the methods included with this package use those terms
as their names.

For convenience, compilation of the regular expressions is wrapped
along with the capture functionality so that, in simple cases, import
of the Go regexp standard library may not be needed.
